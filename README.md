# Airbnb Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, titled "Airbnb Analysis," explores data related to the travel industry, property management, and tourism. The primary objective is to gain insights from Airbnb data using Python scripting, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques. Additionally, we aim to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), build a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, and store data in MongoDB. Finally, we plan to utilize PowerBI or Tableau for advanced data visualization.

## Skills Gained

Throughout this project, you will gain the following skills:

- Python scripting for data analysis and manipulation.
- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Data visualization to effectively communicate findings.
- Building a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for data presentation.
- Storing and retrieving data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
- Advanced data visualization using PowerBI or Tableau for in-depth analysis and reporting.

## Project Scope

The project's scope includes:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data related to Airbnb listings, bookings, and reviews.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. Data Analysis: Use Python scripting to perform EDA and gain insights into the data.

4. Streamlit Dashboard: Create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using Streamlit to present key findings.

5. MongoDB Integration: Store and retrieve data using MongoDB for scalability and flexibility.

6. Advanced Visualization: Utilize PowerBI or Tableau to create visualizations and reports for in-depth analysis and decision-making.

## Getting Started

Before you start with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
